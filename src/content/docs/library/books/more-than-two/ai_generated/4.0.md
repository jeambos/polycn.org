Despite what you may think after what you’ve read so far, most of the time nonmonogamous relationships are pretty much like monogamous relationships. There’s coffee and movies and cuddling and sex and talking, meals and arguments and chores and balancing the house accounts. (Okay, maybe there’s more talking.) Plenty of situations are unique to nonmonogamy, though, and many things that also crop up in monogamous relationships involve special considerations when more than two people are involved.

尽管读了这么多你可能会有各种想法，但大多数时候，非单偶制关系和单偶制关系非常相似。这里有咖啡、电影、拥抱、性爱和交谈，有吃饭、争吵、家务和家庭账目平衡。（好吧，也许交谈会更多一些。）不过，有很多情况是非单偶制独有的，而且许多在单偶制关系中也会出现的事情，当涉及两个以上的人时，就需要特别的考量。

In Part 4, we go deep into the nuts and bolts of nonmonogamous relationships. First we examine how nonmonogamous relationships are different from the way people are often taught relationships should work. Then we look at special considerations for a few common nonmonogamous configurations. We then get into the common challenges with opening up a coupled relationship, followed by looking at the special issues that come up when a nonmonogamous person partners with a monogamous one. We cover how to find nonmonogamous partners, and then get into the finer details of managing relationships among multiple partners. After that we move on to considerations around sex and risk, which are important for any sexual relationship, but all the more so when more people are involved. We finish off with some thoughts on the special challenges that come with nonmonogamous breakups and relationship transitions.

在第 4 部分，我们将深入探讨非单偶制关系的具体细节。首先，我们将审视非单偶制关系与人们通常被教导的关系运作方式有何不同。然后，我们看看几种常见非单偶制配置的特殊考量。接着我们将探讨开放伴侣关系时的常见挑战，随后看看当非单偶制者与单偶制者结伴时会出现的特殊问题。我们涵盖了如何寻找非单偶制伴侣，然后深入探讨在多个伴侣之间管理关系的更细微细节。之后我们转向关于性和风险的考量，这对任何性关系都很重要，但在涉及更多人时尤为重要。最后，我们将以对非单偶制分手和关系转变所带来的特殊挑战的一些思考作为结束。
